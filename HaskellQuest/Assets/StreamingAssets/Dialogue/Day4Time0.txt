(You now decide what you do each day. There is only enough time to go to class or to have ONE attempt at breaking into a system.)
(Going to class levels up your education which will unlock new but more complicated systems that reward more money.)
(Some classes require you to complete a worksheet after the class is over.)
(Alternatively you can spend your day attempting to break into one of the systems.)
(However make sure you have enough money at the end of each day to pay for you bills and food.)
